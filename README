Randime

A website for offering random anime suggestions. Right now this uses FastCGI
with my Rapunzel library. The user loads the page, and the FastCGI program
returns HTML describing a random anime from it's database.

Right now there is just support for Funimation, but more scrapers will be added.

I also plan to add WebSockets in the future, so that people with Javascript
can get a nice AJAX experience; without breaking it for plain HTML users.
